Subject: [PATCH] Silence disk stat warnings

Adding this warning was useful to find the need to de-reference mount
sources, but now it's mainly creating noise considering our ecryptfs
volumes don't show up in diskstats.

In practice, we're not really using those stats for much, so it's fine
if they are missing.
